# you-draw-it

The New York Times publishes impressive interactive visualizations on their
website. The most recent one allowed users to draw a graph and compare it to a
graph drawn by real data. You can see the original article and
visualization [here][nytimes]. I noticed the interaction felt similar to
something I built for [twodots][twodots], so I took a stab at implementing a
similar interactive graph with [D3][d3].
